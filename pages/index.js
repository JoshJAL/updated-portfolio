            Joshua is a full-stack developer based in Tampa, Florida. With a
            passion for solving problems, both physical and digital. He began on
            a law school track but his love for computers and desire to
            problem-solve for as many people as possible led him to a career in
            web and software development. When not online he loves tinkering as
            much as possible whether that be building computers or playing board
            games with his family. Currently, he is open to new opportunities
            and can be reached{' '}

            Building computers, spending time with my family and learning as
            many new things as I can. I like to stay up to date with the latest
            technology and am always looking for an excuse to work with my hands
            whether that be writing code, building computers, or the occasional
            excuse to work on a car.
